Hare will use a simple text-based protocol for communication between clients and the Hare server. Each message will consist of a command and optional arguments, separated by spaces. Here are some example commands:

- PUBLISH <exchange> <routing_key> <message_body>: Publish a message to the  specified exchange with the given routing key.
- CONSUME <queue>: Start consuming messages from the specified queue.
- ACK <message_id>: Acknowledge the consumption of a message.
- CREATE EXCHANGE <name> <type>: Create a new exchange.
- CREATE QUEUE <name>: Create a new queue.
- BIND QUEUE <queue> <exchange> <routing_key>: Bind a queue to an exchange.
